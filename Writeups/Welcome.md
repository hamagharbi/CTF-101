# Welcome Writeup

**Description:**

Just run me, a special message is waiting for you <3

**Attachment:**
[welcome](../Files/welcome)

## Solution

We start by running the command `file` to know the type of our file:
    
    welcome: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=f4a84ce894e576667091f6cbeea1a6f8fcbb5f34, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
We notice that our file is a linux executable so all we need is to run the file in a linux environment.

When we run our program, it gives us this special output:
    
    ==    W E L C O M E    ==
    -- Author: O T C --
    Hey you! Yes, you! Do you wanna know something?
    Well, all I can say is this...
    Since I was a little boy who grew up loving everything
    for you to want me is special because I have always wanted YOU.
    My soul no longer belongs to me.
    And you know why?
    Because I gave my soul to this this field and you people a long time ago.
    I love you all!!
    Here is your flag my dear ==> FL1TZ{N3v3r_S4y_N3v3r} <==

It is a special message for you players <3

    FL1TZ{N3v3r_S4y_N3v3r}
